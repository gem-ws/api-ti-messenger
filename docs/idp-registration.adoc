== Summary

This document describes the process to register a TI-Messenger providers Registration-Service with the gematik IDP.

Only german healthcare organizations with a SMC-B smartcard are permitted to order a Messenger-Service from a TI-Messenger-Provider. The messenger-service can be ordered on a portal of the TI-Messenger-Provider called Registration-Service. One way to prove the posession of a SMC-B smartcard is the authentication on the gematik IDP with OIDC authorization code flow. The Registration-Service must be known by the IDP. This is achieved by the registration process.
